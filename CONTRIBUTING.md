## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to abide by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please read it before contributing.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/EntangledMultimodalSystem.git
   cd EntangledMultimodalSystem
   ```

2. **Setup Development Environment**
   ```bash
   # Create virtual environment
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

   # Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

3. **Run Tests**
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

## Development Workflow

1. **Create a Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make Changes**
   - Follow the code style guide
   - Write tests for new features
   - Update documentation

3. **Commit Changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
   ```

4. **Push Changes**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Code Style Guide

### Python Code Style

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) guidelines
- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Document all public functions and classes with docstrings
- Keep functions focused and small (under 50 lines)
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Example

```python
def calculate_quantum_state(
    initial_state: np.ndarray,
    operations: List[QuantumGate]
) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Calculate the final quantum state after applying operations.
    
    Args:
        initial_state: Initial quantum state vector
        operations: List of quantum gates to apply
        
    Returns:
        Final quantum state vector
    """
    state = initial_state.copy()
    for gate in operations:
        state = gate.apply(state)
    return state
```

## Testing Guidelines

1. **Test Coverage**
   - Maintain at least 80% test coverage
   - Write unit tests for all new features
   - Include integration tests for critical paths

2. **Test Structure**
   ```python
   def test_feature():
       # Setup
       initial_state = np.array([1, 0])
       
       # Action
       result = calculate_quantum_state(initial_state, [HadamardGate()])
       
       # Assertion
       assert np.allclose(result, expected_state)
   ```

## Documentation

1. **Code Documentation**
   - Use docstrings for all modules, classes, and functions
   - Follow Google style docstrings
   - Include examples in docstrings where appropriate

2. **Project Documentation**
   - Update README.md for significant changes
   - Add or update relevant sections in docs/
   - Include architecture diagrams using Mermaid

## Security

1. **Security Considerations**
   - Never commit sensitive information
   - Follow security best practices
   - Report security vulnerabilities responsibly

2. **Security Reporting**
   - Email security@example.com for vulnerabilities
   - Include detailed description and steps to reproduce
   - Wait for acknowledgment before public disclosure

## Pull Request Process

1. **Create Pull Request**
   - Use the provided PR template
   - Link related issues
   - Include test coverage information

2. **PR Checklist**
   - [ ] Tests added/updated
   - [ ] Documentation updated
   - [ ] Code follows style guide
   - [ ] Security considerations addressed
   - [ ] Performance impact considered

3. **Review Process**
