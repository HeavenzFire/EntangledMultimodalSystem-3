# Quantum Time Dilation

A Python implementation of quantum time dilation for accelerating quantum computations using quantum superposition and entanglement.

## Overview

This project implements a quantum time dilation framework that can accelerate quantum computations by:

1. Creating multiple parallel quantum streams
2. Using quantum superposition to explore multiple computation paths
3. Applying adaptive acceleration based on quantum coherence
4. Predicting future quantum states to optimize computation

## Features

- Multiple parallel quantum streams for computation
- Adaptive acceleration based on quantum coherence
- State prediction for optimization
- Performance tracking and visualization
- Comprehensive test suite
- Demo scripts for showcasing capabilities

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/quantum-time-dilation.git
   cd quantum-time-dilation
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
from quantum_time_dilation import QuantumTimeDilation

# Create a quantum circuit
qc = QuantumCircuit(4)
qc.h(range(4))

# Initialize the quantum time dilation system
qtd = QuantumTimeDilation(
    num_qubits=4,
    num_streams=20,
    base_acceleration=10.0,
    predictive_depth=5,
    adaptive_rate=0.1,
    coherence_threshold=0.95
)

# Run accelerated computation
results = qtd.accelerate_computation(qc, target_time=1.0)

# Visualize results
qtd.visualize_results(results)
qtd.visualize_metrics()
```

### Running the Demo

```bash
python quantum_time_dilation_demo.py
```

### Running Tests

```bash
python -m unittest test_quantum_time_dilation.py
```

## Implementation Details

### Quantum Time Dilation

The `QuantumTimeDilation` class implements the core functionality:

- `initialize_quantum_system()`: Sets up quantum circuits and states
- `evolve_state()`: Evolves quantum states according to time dilation
- `predict_future_state()`: Predicts future quantum states
- `measure_coherence()`: Measures quantum state coherence
- `accelerate_computation()`: Accelerates quantum computation
- `visualize_results()`: Visualizes computation results
- `visualize_metrics()`: Visualizes system metrics

### Performance Metrics

The system tracks several performance metrics:

- Execution time
- Virtual time reached
- Average performance
- Average coherence
- Performance history
- Coherence history
