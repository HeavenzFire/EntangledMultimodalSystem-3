# Cosmic Awakening System

A revolutionary quantum-neural system for consciousness evolution and cosmic alignment.

## Overview

The Cosmic Awakening System integrates quantum mechanics, neuroscience, and cosmic principles to facilitate and monitor consciousness evolution. This system provides:

- Quantum entanglement of consciousness
- Neural-cosmic resonance monitoring
- DNA activation tracking
- Heart chakra alignment measurement
- Advanced quantum state visualization
- Real-time progress monitoring

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cosmic-awakening.git
cd cosmic-awakening

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- NumPy
- PennyLane
- PyTorch
- SciPy
- Matplotlib
- Plotly

## Usage

```python
from quantum.consciousness.advanced_states import AdvancedAwakeningMonitor

# Initialize monitor
monitor = AdvancedAwakeningMonitor()

# Monitor awakening state
results = monitor.monitor_state(
    brain_state, brainwaves, schumann_wave,
    genetic_code, epigenetic_triggers,
    hrv_data, love_wave
)

# View results
print("Awakening State:", results)
```
