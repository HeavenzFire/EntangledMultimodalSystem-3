# Security Documentation

## Overview

The Entangled Multimodal System implements a multi-layered security approach combining quantum cryptography, ethical constraints, and traditional security measures to protect both the system and its users.

## Security Layers

### 1. Quantum Security Layer

#### Quantum Encryption

- Post-quantum cryptographic algorithms (Kyber-768)
- Quantum key distribution
- Quantum random number generation
- Fractal-based encryption patterns

#### Quantum Threat Detection

- Real-time quantum state monitoring
- Entanglement-based intrusion detection
- Quantum signature verification
- Fractal pattern analysis

### 2. Ethical Security Layer

#### Ethical Constraints

- Suffering prevention (threshold: 0.8)
- Transparency enforcement (threshold: 0.7)
- Collective good alignment (threshold: 0.9)
- Maximum threat level (0.07)

#### Ethical Monitoring

- Real-time ethical compliance checking
- Violation logging and reporting
- Automated ethical constraint updates
- Collective consensus verification

### 3. Traditional Security Layer

#### Authentication & Authorization

- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- Multi-factor authentication
- Session management

#### Network Security

- SSL/TLS encryption
- Firewall protection
- Rate limiting
- CORS policies

#### Data Protection

- Encryption at rest
- Secure data transmission
- Regular backups
- Data retention policies

## Security Features
